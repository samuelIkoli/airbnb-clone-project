# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

## Team Roles
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
Example of key entities required for the project are; Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments.
Users have an ID, auser can have multiple properties, a booking belongs to a property, a review is owned/authored by a user, a payment is owned/made by a user. e.t.c.

## Feature Breakdown
- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## API Security
- Authentication & Authorization: Ensure users are authenticated and only allowed to access actions based on their assigned roles (e.g., guest, host, admin).

- Input Validation & Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other malicious payloads.

- Database & Query Protection: Use ORM or parameterized queries and restrict sensitive fields in API responses to prevent unauthorized data access.

- Secure File Uploads: Limit uploads to safe file types, scan for viruses, and serve files through a secure CDN or media server.

- HTTPS Everywhere: Encrypt all communication using TLS and enforce HTTPS using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

- Session Management: Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies and implement session timeout to reduce the risk of hijacking.

- Payment Security (PCI Compliance): Handle payments through PCI-compliant providers like Stripe and verify webhook authenticity.

- Secure Messaging System: Filter message content, prevent sharing of contact details, and protect against spam or abuse.

- API Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection: Limit requests per user/IP to prevent brute-force attacks, scraping, and abuse.

- Monitoring & Incident Response: Log errors, monitor suspicious activity, and maintain audit trails to quickly detect and respond to threats.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD pipelines, which stand for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, are automated workflows used to streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code. Continuous Integration ensures that every code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main project without breaking existing functionality. Continuous Deployment goes a step further by automatically pushing these verified changes to staging or production environments.

CI/CD is important because it helps the team release new features and updates quickly and reliably. It improves code quality by catching errors early through automated testing and reduces the risk of bugs reaching users. CI/CD also enhances team collaboration by allowing multiple developers to contribute without conflicts and eliminates manual deployment errors through automation. Overall, it ensures faster, safer, and more consistent delivery of product updates.
